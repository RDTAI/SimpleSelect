# Simple CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification with Selection Mechanism

This project implements a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The key enhancement of this model is the addition of a selection layer for each output head, allowing the network to determine whether to retain or discard each output.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to perform image classification while adding an extra layer in the output that helps decide whether to keep the predictions or not. This mechanism can potentially improve the model's performance by focusing on the most relevant outputs.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. This code will automatically download the dataset if it is not already present.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SimpleSelect.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SimpleSelect
   ```

3. **Run the training and testing**:
   You can specify the number of epochs in the `train_model` function in the script. By default, the code is set to run for 10 epochs.
   ```python
   train_model(num_epochs=10)
   ```

## Output

After training, the model will output the training loss for each epoch and the accuracy for both the original model predictions and the retained predictions.
